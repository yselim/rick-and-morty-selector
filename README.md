## EXPLANATION FROM YAVUZ SELİM DOĞAN

* I added a 500ms debouncer in order to prevent making unnecessary requests while typing.
* I did not use tailwind, material ui. etc. It is just plain css.
* I made the component re-usable. So I put it in th organisms folder (as if in atomic design principles). You can easily use that component for different kind of data structures.




## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
